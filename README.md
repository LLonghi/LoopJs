# LoopJs
JS Version of the LoopHero game, justo for fun and skill tests.


For now, its just a MVP, loots of test code and not that good functions too.
The point is getting the game to work first(MVP!!!) and then start cleaning the room.



All the original game cc goes to its devs, this code does not reflect any of the actual game code, it is being developed by me just for study and is not indeed to any comercial use, and also all the images/assets will be changed to non cc in the future :)
